# Neural Network REU22
Training a neural network practice for Undergraduate Research Program led by Dr. Hao Zheng in Summer 2022



These programs have been built as Neural Network Models that recognize and attempt to "learn" from the data that has been inputted. 
These neural networks implement DEEP LEARNING by imitating the network of neurons inspired by the human brain. 

In this case, 
These programs are three-layer feedforward neural networks (using numpy). This means that the neural network only works in one direction
and does not continously loop through. 
What the neural network is doing:
It is adding random weights to the synaptic connections (that connect all the neurons together in a multi-layer model). Then, is training itself using 
the training set that has been defined within the algorithm. Lastly, when a new situation is inputted, the neural network predicts a value. 
We test this value to see whether the predicted value is close to the expected value.
